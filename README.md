## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Addis Ababa University (GPA: 3.68/4.0), with a deep interest in backend development, embedded systems, and problem-solving through code. I'm currently part of the **Africa to Silicon Valley (A2SV)** program, sharpening my skills in algorithms and system design.

I thrive in collaborative environments and love building efficient, scalable software systems with clean architecture. Whether it’s designing RESTful APIs in Go or debugging circuit designs, I bring curiosity and grit to every challenge.
